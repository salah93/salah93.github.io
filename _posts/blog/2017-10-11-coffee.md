# Coffee
	I drink coffee a lot. The taste is really not that great. I would rather tea, but in coffee there is class. Men drink coffee. Give me a cup of Joe, black no sugar. Working man needs his coffee.
	My dad drinks coffee ritualistically. A fond memory I hold onto, for reasons I'll leave for you to diagnose, is of us two going for coffee one chicago early-morning, before the day demanded of us our (his) time. He takes it with cream and a lot of sugar. Sugar is no good for you, I think but never say. The man's earned his coffee.
	Most of the time I never finish the damn thing. I bought a coffee machine and a grinder to complete my genesis. I am become coffee, the starter of worlds. I imagined it to be a brilliant idea; this will make me happy. My wife and me sharing a cup of coffee early mornings, our own little ritual. Hold the sugar love, its no good for you. `
