# Vroom Vroom

<p>I have always wanted a motorcycle. Well, maybe always. I've wanted a motorcycle for a long time. Maybe since highschool, since I was aware of social standing and my place in the world. I've thought about how I would handle myself with my prized bike. No pictures, nobody can know about it. Atleast, not from me directly. I shouldn't broadcast it, no pictures on instagram. The idea was people would find out "accidentally", maybe stuck in a red light they'd notice their friend on a bike next to them. He's so cool. I wanted people to know, but I didn't want them knowing that I wanted them to know, that I cared if they knew. What if nobody every knew? That comes with the risk of being cool, maybe nobody would ever know and I would have to accept that. That doesn't make sense to me anymore, I've learned to not care what people might think of you, whether or not they appreciate your boasts on social media. Well, care less. If I ever do get a motorcycle, the rule would be to post pictures of me riding along a highway. He's so cool.</p>
